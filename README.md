# TypingMind Cloud Backup Extension

## Features
- Extension to enable automatic backup & restore of app data to AWS S3/S3 compatible cloud services. (Full backup, not incremental)
- The entire typingmind data will be stored in S3 as a single JSON file. This file is overwritten each time a backup is written to S3.
- Automatically restores the latest backup version from S3 to your TypingMind instance when you load the app (provided a backup exists).
- Enables automatic backing up of your TypingMind data to S3 throughout the session as per the configured backup interval.
- Last 30 days 'backup of backup' for a stress free experience. Apart from the single backup file, the extension now creates a daily 'no-touch' zipped backup of the main backup file. In case the main backup file gets corrupted, you can restore it using the previous day's backup.
- Snapshot lets you backup the current typingmind data to the cloud when you need it. This is a 'no-touch' zipped backup that will permanently exist in the cloud till you choose to delete it.
- A 'T-15 rolling snapshot' keeps a zipped snapshot of the typingmind instance from 15 minutes ago. This gives you a recent version of the backup that you can manually revert to in case of an unintended corruption of the main backup file. However, note that this is a rolling backup that gets overwritten every 15 minutes.
- Allows you to view all the backups in the cloud and lets you download it or restore from the UI itself. The snapshot backups can be deleted from the UI as well.
- âœ¨ The backup interval is now configurable.
  
## Using this extension
WARNING: Ensure you take a local backup from "SETTINGS > APPDATA & STORAGE > EXPORT" before setting up the extension.
1. Logout of Typingmind
2. Load "https://itcon-pty-au.github.io/typingmind-cloud-backup/s3.js" into Menu > Preferences > Extension in Typingmind.
3. Once the extension is installed, a new Backup button will be added to the menu. Clicking on this will bring up the S3 backup configuration form.
4. Provide the AWS details in the form. [These are stored locally in your browser]
5. The save button checks if there is a backup already in S3, if yes it restores it and updates the local typingmind instance.
6. Manually refresh the page to reflect the new data. CTRL + F5 if it does not.
7. If there is no backup in S3, it is expected that you click on the "Export to S3" button in the configuration form to kickstart the backup process.
8. You can do on demand cloud backups and restore using the respective buttons in the form - "Export to S3" and "Import from S3".
9. Full backup to S3 is performed every minute automatically.
10. Whenever the page is loaded, it pulls the latest backed up version from S3 and refreshes the data. You may need to do a Ctrl + F5 (Force refresh) to make it reflect in the UI.

## AWS Config
1. Create a user in Amazon IAM. In permissions option, select "Add user to group" but don't select any group. In next screen, "Create user".
2. Open the user. Create Access Key for the user. In Step 1, select "Other", you can skip Step 2 and directly create Access Key. Copy the Access key and Secret Key and store it securely. You will need this to configure the extension.
3. Create a bucket with the default settings. Due to security reasons, it is recommended to create a new bucket for Typingmind backup and ensure that no other files are stored in it.
4. Open Bucket > Permissions > Bucket Policy
```yaml
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::<AWS Account ID>:user/<IAM username>"
      },
      "Action": [
        "s3:ListBucket",
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:PutObject",
        "s3:DeleteObject"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::<AWS bucket name>",
        "arn:aws:s3:::<AWS bucket name>/*"
      ]
    },
    {
      "Sid": "PreventSpecificFileDeletion",
      "Effect": "Deny",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::<AWS Account ID>:user/<IAM username>"
      },
      "Action": "s3:DeleteObject",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::<AWS bucket name>/typingmind-backup.json"
    }
  ]
}
```
Update AWS Account ID, IAM username and AWS bucket name in the policy with your specific values.

5. Open Bucket > Permissions > CORS
```yaml
[
  {
    "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
    "AllowedMethods": ["HEAD", "GET", "PUT", "POST", "DELETE"],
    "AllowedOrigins": ["https://*.hostname.com"],
    "ExposeHeaders": ["Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "ETag"],
    "MaxAgeSeconds": 3000
  }
]
```
If you are using typingmind cloud, use the below
```yaml
[
  {
    "AllowedHeaders": ["*"],
    "AllowedMethods": ["HEAD", "GET", "PUT", "POST", "DELETE"],
    "AllowedOrigins": ["https://www.typingmind.com"],
    "ExposeHeaders": ["Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "ETag"],
    "MaxAgeSeconds": 3000
  }
]
```
Update "https://*.hostname.com" with your specific hostname in case you are self hosting Typingmind (e.g. https://chat.yourhostname.com). If you are using Typingmind cloud, hostname should be https://www.typingmind.com. This restricts executing S3 commands from only the specified hostname providing better security.

## Cloudflare R2/S3 compatible setup
Cloudflare R2 provides S3 compatible API with a generous 10GB free storage per month. Refer [How to setup Cloudflare R2 and use with this extension](https://github.com/itcon-pty-au/typingmind-cloud-backup/blob/main/Cloudflare_R2_HowTo.docx)

## Warning
The extension stores the storage provider credentials in the browser storage (like the original typingmind app) and this is not a secure method. The only option you have is to minimize damage caused if someone gets access to the credentials. i.e. Provide minimum permissions to the credentials. For Amazon S3, I have provided access policy above. However, for other S3 compatible providers, its up to you to setup proper access policies.
